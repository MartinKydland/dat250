# Technical problems
It seems I could only execute GET requests through postman. I did not get the delete and create functions to work in the todo program, or it was postman which weirded out.
## Code
Right now you can find only what I believe was working [here](https://github.com/MartinKydland/dat250/tree/master/counters/src/main/java/no/hvl/dat110/rest/counters)
## Problems which persist
My knowledge of postman and postman and spark needs refining in order to finish the C and D functions of the CRUD functions. I will get back to the task at a later time.
